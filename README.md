# Website

This is the repo for a website that I use as a startpage and playground for learning new frameworks.

This version is built with [Sveltekit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and deployed as a [docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/dellhplaptop/my-startpage).

Little button that gives me dopamine
